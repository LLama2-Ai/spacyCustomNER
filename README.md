# Data Masking

### Problem: Mask the personal information from the email 
Instead of going with state-of-the-art models(Transformers) and relying 100% on probability. <br>
I decided to go with <b> ðŸ§¯ SPACY (rule-based + ML-based)</b>, To decrease the chances of error. <br><br>

<I> ðŸ’™ And wanted to share the base version of my code with you guys</i>.

#### And got inspiring results even on the first try.

### Requirements.
<ul>
  <li> <b>Data:</b> to capture the names correctly, As names cannot be done with the rule-based approach </li>
  <li> <b> Regular expressions:</b> to fetch phoneNo,Dates,Email addresses, Card details  </li>
</ul>
