# Data Masking

## Overview
Some time ago I faced an issue of data masking, Instead of going with state-of-the-art models(Transformers) and relying 100% on probability, 
I decided to go with spacy (rule-based + ML-based), To decrease the chances of error.

And got inspiring results even on the first try. 
### Problem: Mask the personal information from the email

### Requirements.
<ul>
  <li> <b>Data:</b> to capture the names correctly, As names cannot be done with the rule-based approach </li>
  <li> <b> Regular expressions:</b> to fetch phoneNo,Dates,Email addresses, Card details  </li>
</ul>
